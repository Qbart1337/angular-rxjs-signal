# AngularRxjsSignal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0-rc.1.

## Issues

- How to mix NgModules & standalone in one project
- How is the rendering behaviour if rxjs, signal & interop getting used?
- Which lifecyles will be kicked of on each solution?
- Is zone.js still needed as package if i wrap rxjs with signals?
- async / await (is Promises back to angular?) useful with signal

## Later Issues
- ngrx, akita etc (global stores) support
